# skate-therapy-website-node
This is an on-going project for SkateTherapy, an organization I do volunteer work for.
SkateTherapy is an ice skating program for children with disabilities. We give them mostly one-on-one skating lessons with experienced ice skaters. The environment is fun, positive, and a great social outlet!

I'm recreating my Skate Therapy website using node, express, mustache-express, and bootstrap! Collaboration with Baylie Warrick.
